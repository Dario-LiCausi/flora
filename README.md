# Flora

Flora is a local, private LLM setup designed for **controlled use**, not automation.

It runs on a local model backend and is built around a few strict ideas:
- no autonomous actions
- no hidden state
- no implicit memory
- no cloud by default

Everything is explicit, inspectable, and reversible.

The project focuses on:
- prompt and behaviour control
- external, file-based memory
- clear separation between reasoning and execution

This repository contains the **foundation layer** only.  
Capabilities are added deliberately, not assumed.

Status: early but stable.
